## Let's submit your own Pen today
Welcome to PenCrafts! We're excited to see what kind of stories you have to share with our community of readers and writers. To submit your story, follow these steps:

To submit your story to PenCrafts, you'll first need to join our Discord server. It's quick, easy, and free! Once you're there, head over to the "Submissions" channel, where you'll find all the information you need to get started. Follow the simple steps outlined there, and voila! Your story will be on its way to a whole new audience.

- Step 1: Read the Submission Guidelines

Before submitting your story, it's important to read our submission guidelines. These guidelines will outline the specific requirements and preferences that we have for story submissions, such as word count, genre, and formatting. Make sure to read them carefully to ensure that your story meets our standards.

!!!danger
Don't skip this step! Failing to follow our submission guidelines may result in your story being rejected.
!!!

- Step 2: Prepare Your Story for Submission

Once you've read the submission guidelines, prepare your story for submission. Make sure that your story meets all of the requirements listed in the guidelines. Check your grammar and spelling, and make sure your story is in the correct format, such as a PDF or a Word document.

!!!warning
Don't submit incomplete or unedited drafts of your story. Make sure your story is polished and complete before submitting it to us.
!!!

- Step 3: Submit Your Story

When you're ready to submit your story, head over to the "Submissions" channel and attach your document to your submission message. Provide a brief summary of your story, including the genre and word count. This will help our editors get a sense of what your story is about.

!!!warning
Don't submit multiple copies of your story or spam the Submissions channel. Doing so may result in your story being rejected and/or your account being removed from the server.
!!!

- Step 4: Wait for Feedback

Once you've submitted your story, our editors will review it and provide feedback within a reasonable timeframe. We take our time to read through each submission carefully, so please be patient!

!!!warning
Don't pester our editors for feedback or ask for special treatment. We treat all submissions equally and fairly.
!!!

- Step 5: Keep Writing

Whether your story is accepted or not, keep writing! The more you write, the better you'll get, and the more likely you'll be to achieve your writing goals. As Stephen King once said, "If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot." So keep honing your craft and sharing your stories with us at PenCrafts!

We hope these steps make it easy for you to submit your stories to PenCrafts. Remember to respect our guidelines and community, and we look forward to reading your submissions!
